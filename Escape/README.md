## How to Play

This game requires Ruby, a free-to-download programming language API found [here](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/).

To run the game, simply download the 'escape.rb' and 'room.rb' files to any directory,
then navigate to that directory in your terminal and enter the following command:
```
ruby escape.rb
```

You are trapped in a strange prison, and the goal is to escape!
You can interact with your environment in various ways, by typing commands into the
prompt and pressing the 'RETURN' key.  KEYWORDS are highlighted to give you an idea
of what to do next.  The game doesn't currently recognize capital letters, so make
sure you type everything in lower-case.  Keep in mind that once you leave a room,
you can always type 'go back' to travel to the previous room.  If you ever get
stuck, try typing 'look' to search your surroundings.  Good luck!
